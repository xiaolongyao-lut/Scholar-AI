# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Comprehensive design guide for web and mobile applications. Contains 50+ styles, 161 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 161 product types with reasoning rules, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 10 technology stacks. Searchable database with priority-based recommendations.

## When to Apply

This Skill should be used when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**.

### Must Use

This Skill must be invoked in the following situations:

- Designing new pages (Landing Page, Dashboard, Admin, SaaS, Mobile App)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts, etc.)
- Choosing color schemes, typography systems, spacing standards, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for user experience, accessibility, or visual consistency
- Implementing navigation structures, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, information hierarchy, brand expression)
- Improving perceived quality, clarity, or usability of interfaces

### Recommended

This Skill is recommended in the following situations:

- UI looks "not professional enough" but the reason is unclear
- Receiving feedback on usability or experience
- Pre-launch UI quality optimization
- Aligning cross-platform design (Web / iOS / Android)
- Building design systems or reusable component libraries

### Skip

This Skill is not needed in the following situations:

- Pure backend logic development
- Only involving API or database design
- Performance optimization unrelated to the interface
- Infrastructure or DevOps work
- Non-visual scripts or automation tasks

**Decision criteria**: If the task will change how a feature **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**, this Skill should be used.

- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive, etc.
- **Stack**: React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, or other

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

Always start with a comprehensive design system that includes:
1. Product type pattern and layout recommendation
2. Style selection with rationale
3. Color palette with semantic tokens
4. Typography pairing and scale
5. Spacing and elevation system
6. Anti-patterns to avoid for this product type

### Step 3: Supplement with Domain-Specific Guidance

After defining the design system, use the domain rules above to get detailed guidance:

- **Accessibility issues** → Priority 1 rules
- **Touch and interaction problems** → Priority 2 rules
- **Performance concerns** → Priority 3 rules
- **Style mismatches** → Priority 4 rules
- **Layout breaks** → Priority 5 rules
- **Typography / color issues** → Priority 6 rules
- **Animation problems** → Priority 7 rules
- **Form / feedback issues** → Priority 8 rules

## Common Rules for Professional UI

These are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional.

### Icons & Visual Elements

| Rule | Standard | Avoid | Why It Matters |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **No Emoji as Structural Icons** | Use vector-based icons (e.g., Lucide, Heroicons) | Using emojis (🎨 🚀 ⚙️) for navigation / system controls | Emojis are font-dependent, inconsistent across platforms |
| **Vector-Only Assets** | Use SVG or platform vector icons that scale cleanly | Raster PNG icons that blur or pixelate | Ensures scalability, crisp rendering, and dark/light mode adaptability |
| **Consistent Icon Sizing** | Define icon sizes as design tokens (icon-sm, icon-md = 24pt, icon-lg) | Mixing arbitrary values like 20pt / 24pt / 28pt randomly | Maintains rhythm and visual hierarchy |
| **Stroke Consistency** | Use a consistent stroke width (e.g., 1.5px or 2px) | Mixing thick and thin stroke styles arbitrarily | Inconsistent strokes reduce perceived polish |
| **Touch Target Minimum** | Minimum 44×44pt interactive area (use hitSlop if icon is smaller) | Small icons without expanded tap area | Meets accessibility and platform usability standards |

### Interaction (App)

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Tap feedback** | Provide clear pressed feedback (ripple/opacity/elevation) within 80-150ms | No visual response on tap |
| **Animation timing** | Keep micro-interactions around 150-300ms with platform-native easing | Instant transitions or slow animations (>500ms) |
| **Accessibility focus** | Ensure screen reader focus order matches visual order | Unlabeled controls or confusing focus traversal |
| **Disabled state clarity** | Use disabled semantics, reduced emphasis, and no tap action | Controls that look tappable but do nothing |
| **Gesture conflict prevention** | Keep one primary gesture per region | Overlapping gestures causing accidental actions |

### Light/Dark Mode Contrast

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Text contrast (light)** | Maintain body text contrast >=4.5:1 against light surfaces | Low-contrast gray body text |
| **Text contrast (dark)** | Maintain primary text contrast >=4.5:1 on dark surfaces | Dark mode text that blends into background |
| **Border and divider visibility** | Ensure separators are visible in both themes | Theme-specific borders disappearing in one mode |
| **Token-driven theming** | Use semantic color tokens mapped per theme | Hardcoded per-screen hex values |

### Layout & Spacing

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Safe-area compliance** | Respect top/bottom safe areas for all fixed headers, tab bars, and CTA bars | Placing fixed UI under notch, status bar, or gesture area |
| **8dp spacing rhythm** | Use a consistent 4/8dp spacing system for padding/gaps/section spacing | Random spacing increments with no rhythm |
| **Container width** | Keep predictable content width per device class | Mixing arbitrary widths between screens |
| **Section spacing hierarchy** | Define clear vertical rhythm tiers (e.g., 16/24/32/48) by hierarchy | Similar UI levels with inconsistent spacing |
